After installing the full version of ROS kinetic distro we need to setup ROS by following the below steps. This steps are needed to be performed only once:

**1.** Setting up rosdep systemwide: `$ sudo rosdep init` <br/>
**2.** Setting up rosdep in a user account: `$ rosdep update` <br/>
**3.** Setting up enivronment variables <br/>
   Updating the bashrc file: `$ echo "source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc` <br/>
   Sourcing the bashrc file: `$ source ~/.bashrc` <br/>

## Creating a catkin workspace

```
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/
$ catkin_make
```
Before any updates run the command `$ source devel/setup.bash`
